types of event listener in JavaScript
1)Click Event:

Triggered when a user clicks on an element.

example -
element.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Code to run when the element is clicked
});


2)Mouseover and Mouseout Events:

Triggered when the mouse pointer enters or leaves an element.
example-
 element.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
    // Code to run when the mouse enters the element
  });
  
  element.addEventListener('mouseout', function() {
    // Code to run when the mouse leaves the element
 });
  
3)Submit Event:

Triggered when a form is submitted.

example -
formElement.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  // Code to run when the form is submitted
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the default form submission behavior
});

4)Change Event:

Triggered when the value of an input element changes (e.g., for text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons).

example -
inputElement.addEventListener('change', function() {
  // Code to run when the value changes
});

5)Keydown, Keypress, and Keyup Events:

Triggered when a key on the keyboard is pressed down, when it is pressed and released, and when it is released, respectively.

example - 

document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // Code to run when a key is pressed down
});

document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
  // Code to run when a key is pressed and released
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
  // Code to run when a key is released
});
 
6)Load Event:

Triggered when a page or an image finishes loading.

example-

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  // Code to run when the entire page and its resources have finished loading
});

7)Resize Event:

Triggered when the browser window is resized.
example -
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  // Code to run when the window is resized
});




//Timestamp event listener


In JavaScript, the timestamp associated with events refers to the time (in milliseconds) at which the event occurred.

element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('Event timestamp:', event.timeStamp);
});
In this example, the click event handler is logging the timestamp of the event to the console.

Here's a simple example where the timestamp is used to measure the time between two click events:

let lastClickTimestamp = 0;

element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  const currentTime = event.timeStamp;
  const timeSinceLastClick = currentTime - lastClickTimestamp;

  console.log('Time since last click (ms):', timeSinceLastClick);

  lastClickTimestamp = currentTime;
});
